# Installation
You need <a href="http://bower.io/">bower</a> to resolve the dependencies. In the project folder run:

``bower install``

If you have pyhton installed, you can start serving the project via:

``pyhton -m SimpleHTTPServer``

else use any other webserver to start serving the project directory or just open the index.html in your browser (which might result in errors dependendent on the browser)
